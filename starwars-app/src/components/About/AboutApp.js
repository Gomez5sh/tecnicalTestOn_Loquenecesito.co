          This application was designed for the technical testing of
          Loquenecesito.co, and the purpose of creating an application for Star
          Wars fans.

          This has been a very interesting challenge, which led me to learn a
          lot, although it was not the expected result, I feel that it is quite
          interesting to see<br></br> how you can connect information with the
          client without a backend, and how to implement it in the different
          components of the application.
